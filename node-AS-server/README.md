# AssemblyScript in a node server

assemblyScript has an really easy quick start guide: https://www.assemblyscript.org/quick-start.html

To use automatic garbage collection append the option --exportRuntime when building to export all the API functions that assemblyScript provides.

For the actual build script look at package.json, the rest of the info is covered in the quick start guide!
